        <h2>This is our classic Carpaccio with Arugula</h2>
        
        <p>The classic Carpaccio is a great dish as a appetizer. This cold appetizer from Venice with thin sliced fillet of beef. <br> 
            This dish is delightful to serve during christmas, and other occasions of course. <br>
            Try not to add too much Arugula, that is what restaurants usually do. Try to keep it pure.
